This repository contains a machine learning project that implements a Random Forest classifier to predict breast cancer (malignant vs. benign) using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The project includes:

Key Features
Random Forest Algorithm: Ensemble learning method for classification

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized parameters including:
n_estimators (number of trees)
max_depth
Tree Visualization: Graphical representation of individual decision trees
Comprehensive Evaluation: Includes accuracy

Dataset
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. Features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images.

Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
plot_tree

Usage
Clone the repository
Install required packages
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script
View visualizations and evaluation metrics

Results
The tuned Random Forest model achieves high accuracy in classifying breast tumors as malignant or benign, with detailed visualizations to help understand the model's decision-making process.
